Take ibuprofen as directed by your healthcare provider to reduce fever and alleviate discomfort. Follow the recommended dosage and frequency specified on the medication label or by your healthcare provider.
Avoid consuming alcohol while taking ibuprofen, as it can increase the risk of stomach irritation and may interfere with the medication's effectiveness.'''])
